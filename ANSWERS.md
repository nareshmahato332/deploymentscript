1. It took me around 1 day

task:-
creating django app
dockerfile
dockercompose file
testing

2. if i would have more time i could have more optimized docker images and service configuration file.

3. To deploying in production enviroment. i would do more optimize in docker image and certaily will not use docker-compose file in production. i would use more generic vm based deployment solution using jenkins pipeline script or any other container orchestration solution like kubernetes.

4. I used django for app and bash for deployment script because i am comfortable on these laguage and currently using.

5. Not much challenging but i can say yes creating django app after long time was little bit new.
